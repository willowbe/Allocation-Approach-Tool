<h4 style="text-align: center; color: #8368AE;">Goals</h4>
<p><b>
1. Countering undesirable social impacts of market momentum</b></p>
<p>
Preserving existing fishery structures and demographics, preserving sector diversity; preserving small-scale actors; reducing dislocations stemming from transferability of quotas; preserving cultural value of the fishery; ensuring fishery benefits flow back to the local community
</p>
<p><b>
  2. Ensuring dependent people have access to on the fishery for subsistence</b></p>
<p>Supporting fishery-based livelihoods and ensuring food security; ensuring fishery benefits flow to individuals dependent on them; ensuring access to fishery resources for local stakeholders; preventing exclusion of subsistence fishers.</p>
<p><b>
  3. Fostering adaptation and resilience to ecological change </b></p>
<p>Improving the community’s ability to absorb shocks, and respond to and recover from change; allowing for adaptability and flexibility with changing biological and social conditions; building adaptive management capacity; preparing fishery for climate change.
</p>
<p><b>
  4. Responding to inter-generational equity concerns</b></p>
<p>Ensuring fishing opportunities exist for future generations; enabling means for new entrants to the fishery; ensuring equity in access to the fishery and benefit flows from the fishery is maintained over time.
</p>
<p><b>
  5. Ensure stakeholders' perceived valuation of the new system is an improvement over the status quo </b></p>
  <p>Getting various stakeholders to come to agreement so that new fishery system can come into effect; convincing actors who are “winning” under existing fishery management system to participate for the benefit of everyone; “getting to yes”.
</p>
<p><b>
  6. Incentivize generation of better and more diverse information for management</b></p>
<p>Collecting more and better information for data and management; incentivizing full reporting of catch mortality; incentivizing reporting of other metrics tied to valued outcomes (e.g., discards, habitat damage); generating resources/ funding for improved monitoring, data collection, and assessment of stock and ecosystem health/ status; integrating local ecological knowledge into science and decision-making.
</p>
<p><b>
  7. Incentivize more sustainable fishing and conservation behavior</b></p>
<p>Incentivizing conservation-minded/ sustainable behavior and long-term thinking; incentivizing efficiency (e.g., reducing bycatch) and compliance with regulations; rebuilding stocks and protecting ecosystems.
</p>
<p><b>
  8. Reduce current use rates in order to foster system recovery while still meeting minimum social/ survival needs</b></p>
  <p>Reduce catch levels in the short term to allow stock rebuilding without disadvantaging stakeholder groups who are most dependent on the fishery; balancing short-term goals and long-term goals; ensuring the majority of the burden of reforming the fishery is born by the stakeholders with the greatest capacity to do so; getting through the “valley of death”.
</p>
<p><b>
  9. Foster coordination across elements of the supply chain to match fishing practices with market demand and to increase supply chain transparency</b></p>
  <p>Fostering coordinated, connected, and efficient supply chains that enable realization of full benefits of rationalization; connecting new products (e.g., sustainably-caught species) with new markets (e.g., sustainably minded consumers); increasing supply chain transparency.
</p>
<p><b>
  10. Enhance economic and/or production potential  of the fisher</b></p>
<p>  Improving fishery profitability; improving efficiency of fishery economics (e.g., ending market gluts and dearths); creating a new fishery asset; improving product value.

    <div class="column2" style="text-align: left; width: 40%; float:right; margin: 5px;">
<h4 style="text-align: center; color: #8368AE;">Challenges</h4>
      <p><b>
      A. Stakeholders view rights as entitlements and fail to uphold accompanying responsibilities.</b></p>
      <p>Risk that once rights/ opportunities have been allocated, users may perceive them to be indelible/ irrevocable, and may not consider the potential implications of their own actions on the "rights" of others. In addition, there may be challenges/ push back down the line if regulators need to make any changes in the system (i.e. allowances for new entrants or adjustments based on changes in stock status)
    </p>

      <p><b>
        B. Undesirable market momentum </b></p>
        <p>Risk that economic/ market drivers will push out smaller actors, reducing diversity of fishing techniques and targets, potentially reducing the cultural value of the fishery, and moving benefits out of local community.
      </p>

      <p><b>
        C. Reduced welfare of those dependent on the fisher</b></p>
        <p>Risk that fishery benefits and opportunities will flow away from the people most dependent on the fishery, and largely (or exclusively) toward individuals who already have the most resources, reducing the welfare of the most at-risk groups.
      </p>

      <p><b>
        D. Lack of flexibility, adaptability, and resilience</b></p>
<p>Changing ecosystem conditions (due to climate change or other factors) can change the abundance and/or mix of stocks locally available, making inflexible distributions of fishing rights/ opportunities inappropriate.
      </p>
      <p><b>
        E. Lack of opportunities for new entrants</b></p>
        <p>Inflexible allocation decisions that satisfy the needs and conditions of current system stakeholders may not adequately meet the needs and conditions of future stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p><b>
        F. Lack of buy-in from current "winners"
    </b></p>
    <p>Insufficient support/ buy-in to the system by stakeholders who are doing well under current management system can undermine negotiations (potentially delaying or preventing adoption of new management system) and/or reduce system efficacy (because of non-compliance or continued legal push-back and delays).
      </p>
      <p><b>
        G. Lack of sufficient/ reliable data</b></p>
        <p>Lack of accurate/ reliable data, or lack of faith in the data/ science on the part of stakeholders, can undermine trust and buy-in, as well as the ability of the system to generate sustainable outcomes.
      </p>
      <p><b>
        H. Perverse incentives reduce sustainability</b></p>
        <p>Risk that allocation system will lock in place or incentivize unsustainable resource use by rewarding the most intensive/least sustainable actors (i.e. those who have caught the most in the past).
      </p>
      <p><b>
        I. Poor fishery and ecosystem status makes allocation difficult</b></p>
        <p>Poor fishery and ecosystem status (i.e. overfished stocks) leave very little resource to allocate, making allocation decisions even more difficult.
      </p>
      <p><b>
        J. Need-based illegal fishing </b></p>
        <p>Downturn in the fishery that requires tightening regulations (e.g., reducing TACs) can lead to need-based illegal fishing because some stakeholders have no other options to support themselves.
