If they are above the threshold (e.g., 10% above their quota), they lose a portion of it. The bycatch quota is non-transferable and the additional amount they earn (credit) expires at the end of the season.</p>

Access to the set-aside quota/ area can be used as a temporary reward for participants with the best performance, or can be allocated out permanently or semi-permanently (e.g., until the next review) to align allocations with community values, based on the additional data gathered during the review period. Quota/ area set aside can also be granted for temporary use in “experimental” programs designed to test innovations for minimizing ecosystem impact, improving data collection/ monitoring, or meeting other community goals. </p>

                    <p>The allocation formula is based on equal parts catch history and representation. The sectors to allocate to can be based on environmental factors like gear and vessel size or social factors like race, tribal status, or gender. More groups means reduced capacity. There may be one-way transferability depending on sector definitions. This approach includes a set-aside for future generations.</p>

                    3. Fostering adaptation and resilience to ecological change<br />
                    5. Ensure stakeholders' perceived valuation of the new system is an improvement over the status quo<br />
                    10. Enhance economic and/or production potential of the fishery

                    <p>Multispecies fisheries with heterogeneous (different) species values and catch abilities; fisheries struggling with race-to-fish constraints</p>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Risk of overfishing non-targeted stocks due to lack of data</li>
                      <li>There may not be a market for the other species</li>
                      <li>Risk of conflict with other marine sectors</li>

                    <p>Similar to the Performance Review with Quota Set Aside idea, but uses social pressure to drive compliance -- Quota is allocated out (equal shares, or based on historic catch) with a percentage (or area) set aside and not fished. A periodic review is implemented, and if there is full compliance with system regulations, everyone gets a bonus quota amount (temporarily, semi-permanently, or permanently). Likewise, if one participant does not comply, everyone gets penalized with a quota reduction (and this quota can then be reserved to be used as a potential reward for performance during the following period). </p>
